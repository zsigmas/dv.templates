An R package template with built-in GitHub Actions-based CI/CD workflows.

### Usage

All CI/CD jobs are defined in the [.github/workflows](https://github.com/boehringer-ingelheim/dv.templates/blob/main/.github/workflows) directory in the form of GitHub Action workflows. These can be modified per your requirements, but are designed and implemented to follow best practices and to ensure the highest quality standards for your package.

ðŸ‘‰ For more information on workflows, please refer to the [Workflows documentation](./workflows.md).
